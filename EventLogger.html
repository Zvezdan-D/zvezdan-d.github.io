This add-on works with <a href="http://www.mediamonkey.com/">MediaMonkey</a> v2.x-4.x. It allows logging of many MM events: OnPlay, OnStop, OnPause, OnSeek, OnTrackEnd, OnTrackSkipped, OnTrackProperties, OnTrackAdded, OnTrackDeleting, OnTrackConverted, OnBeforeTracksMove, OnStartUp, OnShutdown... The next data are stored in the log file: date/time, computer/user name, name of the event and track name. The location of the log file could be specified in the Options dialog box. The log file is saved in CSV format, so it could be imported e.g. in Excel. The events could be also displayed in real-time with the Event Viewer dockable panel.

This add-on is donationware. I am its sole developer and I worked on it in my own free time. I am not employed by Ventis Media, the company behind MediaMonkey, nor have I been paid by them for my efforts. If you find my add-on useful and want to help its further development, it would be nice if you could send a small donation using PayPal. You could donate as much as you think that is appropriate, any amount would be really appreciated.

This add-on doesn't work with MediaMonkey v5! No add-on made for a previous version of the program will work with MM5, either by me or any other author, since MM5 has completely different programming interface than before. Which means that all MM4 add-ons have to be rewritten for MM5 from scratch.<br /><br />

If you really like my add-on and think that it is essential for your work with the program, you should stay with MM4. Or you could wait for me to port the add-on to MM5, but my interest for that depends only on donations.<br /><br />

<p><font size="+1"><b><a id="installation">Installation</a></b></font></p>
<ul><li>For MediaMonkey 3.0 or higher - just double-click on the EventLogger-xx.mmip file; if you are on Vista or Win7 and you got "Product installation error", make sure you have MM3 set to <a href="http://www.mediamonkey.com/support/index.php?/Knowledgebase/Article/View/58/0/extensions-cannot-be-installed">"Run as Administrator"</a>; if you downloaded the installation package with IE7 and it changed its extension to a .zip, you should first change it back to a .mmip.</li>
<li>For MediaMonkey 2.x - rename a .mmip extension to a .zip, extract the EventLogger.vbs and EventLoggerGUI.vbs files to the MediaMonkey's "Scripts\Auto" folder and restart MM program.</li></ul>

<p><font size="+1"><b><a id="usage">Usage</a></b></font></p>
Choose <i>View | Event Viewer</i> to show/hide dockable panel. The add-on settings are in the <i>Tools | Options</i> dialog box within the <i>Event Logger</i> sheet (turning on/off of events works immediately after the confirmation only with MM 3.1.0.1205 or higher).<br /><br />

The script developers could use this add-on to display some text from their code by placing few additional lines of code on the appropriate places in the script. The scripters could use MsgBox or SDB.MessageBox instead, but they will halt the execution of the script which is not always desirable. However, Event Logger and/or Event Viewer would log/display such messages without any break of the execution.<br /><br />

Here is what you should do if you want to use Event Viewer to display messages from your script:<br />
- install Event Logger add-on;<br />
- add the line <i>Script.Include "Auto\EventLogger.vbs</i> to your code, e.g. on its begin or end;<br />
- add the line <i>ViewEvent "some_text_e_g_script_name", "actual_text_e_g_some_variable"</i> anywhere where you want to get the displayed message (for example, I could put <i>ViewEvent "Magic Nodes", SDB.MainTree.CurrentNode.Caption</i> in the OnChangedSelection event handler of my script);<br />
- restart the program or use Script.Reload.<br /><br />

If you want to log messages, i.e. to get messages saved to the log file, you should use the <i>LogEvent "abc", "xyz"</i> syntax instead.
