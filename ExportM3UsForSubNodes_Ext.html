This add-on is donationware. I am its sole developer and I work on it in my free time. I am not employed by Ventis Media, the company behind MediaMonkey, and I have not been paid by them for my efforts. If you find my add-on useful and want to contribute to its further development, it would be nice if you could send a small donation using PayPal.<br /><br />

You can donate as much as you think appropriate, but if you donate at least <b>&euro;15 EUR / $18 USD</b> you will receive the <a href="https://zvezdan-d.github.io/ExportM3UsForSubNodesNew.html">enhanced version</a> of the add-on.<br /><br />

The enhanced version of the add-on is sent via e-mail attachment. If your personal e-mail address is different than the one used for Paypal, please send me the details of that info. After donating, if a day or two has passed and you still have not gotten my e-mail, you should check your Spam folder; if you cannot find it in there, please send me an e-mail with the information about your donation to:
<script language="javascript">
<!--
var part1 = "zvezdand";
var part2 = "yahoo.com?subject=Donation for Export/Import Playlists";
var part3 = "zvezdand [at] yahoo [dot] com";
document.write('<a href="mai' + 'lto:' + part1 + '@' + part2 + '">');
document.write(part3 + '</a>');
// -->
</script><noscript>zvezdand [at] yahoo [dot] com</noscript>. To avoid that from happening, I strongly recommend putting my e-mail address in your contact list before you make a donation. This should prevent it from being seen as spam, especially if you use GMail.<br /><br />

Please do not use the mentioned e-mail address just to send me questions and requests about MM5 port of the add-on. I will not answer such e-mails. You should check the info about that in the Compatibility section.<br /><br />

<p><font size="+1"><b><a id="compatibility">Compatibility</a></b></font></p>
This add-on doesn't work with MediaMonkey v5/20xx! No add-on made for a previous version of the program will work with MM5, either by me or any other author, since MM5 has completely different programming interface than before. Which means that all MM4 add-ons have to be rewritten for MM5 from scratch.<br /><br />

If you really like my add-on and think that it is essential for your work with the program, you should stay with MM4. Or you could wait for me to port the add-on to MM5, but my interest for that depends only on donations.<br /><br />
