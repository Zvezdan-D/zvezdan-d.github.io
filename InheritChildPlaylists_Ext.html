This add-on is donationware. I am its sole developer and I work on it in my free time. I am not employed by Ventis Media, the company behind MediaMonkey, and I have not been paid by them for my efforts. If you find my add-on useful and want to contribute to its further development, it would be nice if you could send a small donation using PayPal.<br /><br />

You can donate as much as you think appropriate, but if you donate at least <b>&euro;5 EUR / $6 USD</b> you will receive the <a href="https://zvezdan-d.github.io/InheritChildPlaylistsMM5.html">new version</a> of the add-on for MediaMonkey v5/20xx.<br /><br />

The new version of the add-on is sent via e-mail attachment. If your personal e-mail address is different than the one used for Paypal, please send me the details of that info. After donating, if a day or two has passed and you still have not gotten my e-mail, you should check your Spam folder; if you cannot find it in there, please send me an e-mail with the information about your donation to:
<script language="javascript">
<!--
var part1 = "zvezdand";
var part2 = "yahoo.com?subject=Donation for Inherit Child Playlists";
var part3 = "zvezdand [at] yahoo [dot] com";
document.write('<a href="mai' + 'lto:' + part1 + '@' + part2 + '">');
document.write(part3 + '</a>');
// -->
<!-- </script><noscript>zvezdand [at] yahoo [dot] com</noscript>. To avoid that from happening, I strongly recommend putting my e-mail address in your contact list before you make a donation. This should prevent it from being identified as spam, especially if you use Gmail.<br /><br />

Please do not use the mentioned e-mail address just to send me questions and requests about MM5 port of other add-ons. I will not answer such e-mails. You should check the info about that in the Compatibility section.<br /><br />
