<ul>
<li><b><a href="https://zvezdan-d.github.io/QueueListMM5.html">Queue List</a></b> [MM5+]:<br />It works similarly as the Queue option of Winamp, i.e. it allows creating of the list with tracks that will be played immediately after the currently playing track, no matter if Shuffle is turned on or off. After all tracks from the queue list finish playback, the program continues with the reproduction of the remaining tracks from the Now Playing panel.</li><br />

<li><b><a href="https://zvezdan-d.github.io/InheritChildPlaylistsMM5.html">Inherit Child Playlists</a></b> [MM5+]:<br />This add-on allows parent auto-playlists to optionally inherit their child playlists, which means that the parent auto-playlists will display all tracks of their child playlists, so you could get the same behavior as with iTunes.</li><br />

<li><b><a href="https://zvezdan-d.github.io/FindCurrentPlayingTrackMM5.html">Find Currently Playing Track</a></b> [MM5+]:<br />It allows finding and displaying of the folder that contains the currently playing track within the selected branch of the Media Tree automatically whenever the program starts to play another track. After the containing folder is located, the currently playing track will be selected in the main tracklist.</li><br />

<li><b><a href="https://zvezdan-d.github.io/UpdateLocationOfFilesMM5.html">Update Location of Files</a></b> [MM5+]:<br />Its purpose is to update serial number of a drive and/or paths of files stored in the database, for example after upgrading hard disk or moving files from/to some network drive with UNC paths.</li><br />

</ul><br />

<ul>
<li><b><a href="https://zvezdan-d.github.io/MagicNodes.html">Magic Nodes</a></b> [MM2-4] <img src="New.gif" height="20px" border="0" style="vertical-align: bottom"> <a href="https://zvezdan-d.github.io/MagicNodesNew.html">Enhanced version!</a>:<br />This add-on lets you create new tree nodes in an intuitive and highly configurable way using masks which are loosely based on the way that Auto-organize works. Masks could contain SQL filters, which provides ultimate flexibility for the creation of nodes with Auto-playlist functionality. There are 350+ already predefined masks, for example: artist grouped by first letter [A]-[Z], albums sorted by year, playing statistics, artist/album ratings, random tracks, ...</li><br />

<li><b><a href="https://zvezdan-d.github.io/RegExpReplace.html">RegExp Find and Replace</a></b> [MM2-4] <img src="New.gif" border="0" height="20px" style="vertical-align: bottom"> <a href="https://zvezdan-d.github.io/RegExpReplaceNew.html">Enhanced version!</a>:<br />It allows powerful finding and replacing of strings inside of selected/visible tracks in the main tracklist or the Now Playing panel. The matching criteria and the replacement string can be created using Regular expressions or VBScript expressions which provides very flexible transformations of data. It has a support for custom presets with 250+ already predefined, for example: clear field, copy conditionally full or part of one field to another, swap the first and the last name of Artist, ... Almost all MM fields are supported!</li><br />

<li><b><a href="https://zvezdan-d.github.io/InvertSelection.html">Invert Selection/Select None</a></b> [MM3-4]:<br />It is as an addition to the Select All option and could be used when selecting tracks in the main tracklist or the Now Playing panel. For example, you could have selected all tracks from the first disc of some displayed double-CD album, then you could choose Invert Selection to get selected tracks from the second disc.</li><br />

<li><b><a href="https://zvezdan-d.github.io/ExportM3UsForSubNodes.html">Export/Create Playlists for Child Nodes</a></b> [MM2-4] <img src="New.gif" border="0" height="20px" style="vertical-align: bottom"> <a href="https://zvezdan-d.github.io/ExportM3UsForSubNodesNew.html">Enhanced version!</a>:<br />In the manual mode it allows batch export of playlist files (M3U/ASX/XSPF) or creating of playlists for each child node of the node selected in the tree panel. This works with almost all nodes, even the Magic Nodes. In the automatic mode this add-on periodically saves specified playlist node and its sub-nodes from the Playlists branch. Playlist files could be created using very flexible options, e.g. relative/replaced paths, extended .m3u format, Unix file format...</li><br />

<li><b><a href="https://zvezdan-d.github.io/ExpandChildNodes.html">Expand Child Nodes/Expand All</a></b> [MM2-4]:<br />This add-on expands all child nodes of the selected node or all its sub-nodes recursively (including grand-child nodes).</li><br />

<li><b><a href="https://zvezdan-d.github.io/EventLogger.html">Event Logger</a></b> [MM2-4]:<br />This add-on allows logging of many MM events, for example: OnPlay, OnTrackAdded, OnStartUp, ... Next data are stored in the log file: date/time, computer/user name, name of the event, track name. The log file is saved in CSV format, so it could be imported e.g. in Excel. Events could be also displayed in real-time with the Event Viewer dockable panel.</li><br />

<li><b><a href="https://zvezdan-d.github.io/StatsFiltered.html">Filtered Statistics Report</a></b> [MM3-4]:<br />This add-on contains the modified version of the Stats.vbs script included with the program. This version has added support for MM filters/collections, skin styles, the progress bar, the Options Sheet with a possibility to toggle display of sections in the report, printing of report, saving to .mht file, also corrected many SQL queries and values.</li><br />

<li><b><a href="https://zvezdan-d.github.io/TrackRedirection.html">Track Redirection & Synchronization</a></b> [MM3-4]:<br />This add-on is mainly intended for "one song-many albums" situations - instead of having multiple large audio files for every album with the same song, you could keep just one file for one album and on another albums you could have small .asx files (1-2 KB) instead. The redirections could be created between two or more audio files as well. There is a possibility to automatically synchronize play history and/or specified metadata between linked tracks, as well as to copy tags from the one set of tracks to the another one.</li><br />

<li><b><a href="https://zvezdan-d.github.io/RestorePlayHistory.html">Restore/Synchronize Database</a></b> [MM3-4] <img src="New.gif" border="0" height="20px" style="vertical-align: bottom"> <a href="https://zvezdan-d.github.io/RestorePlayHistoryNew.html">Enhanced version!</a>:<br />It restores or merges the playing history, playlists (auto-playlists and/or static ones), filters / collections and/or the specified metadata (e.g. Artist, Title, Date Added) from/to some backup database file. It could restore/merge data for all tracks in the current database or just filtered/selected ones, even from/to the backup file which is not a copy of the current database.</li><br />

<li><b><a href="https://zvezdan-d.github.io/FindCurrentPlayingTrack.html">Find Currently Playing Track</a></b> [MM2-4]:<br />It allows finding and displaying of the folder that contains the currently playing track within the Library\Location node or the My Computer node automatically whenever the program starts to play another track. After the containing folder is located, the currently playing track will be selected in the main tracklist.</li><br />

<li><b><a href="https://zvezdan-d.github.io/QueueList.html">Queue List</a></b> [MM2-4]:<br />It works similarly as the Queue option of Winamp, i.e. it allows creating of the list with tracks that will be played immediately after the currently playing track, no matter if Shuffle is turned on or off. After all tracks from the queue list finish playback, the program continues with the reproduction of the remaining tracks from the Now Playing panel</li><br />

<li><b><a href="https://zvezdan-d.github.io/AddToLibraryOnPlay.html">Add to Library on Play</a></b> [MM2-4]:<br />It automatically adds tracks to the Library on their playback (if they are not already there) to give MM the same behavior as it is in WMP.</li><br />

<li><b><a href="https://zvezdan-d.github.io/TreeReport.html">Tree Report for Child Nodes</a></b> [MM2-4]:<br />It displays a report with the tree view similar to the Music Explorer Tree panel, but only for child nodes of a selected node. Such report could be printed or saved as a .html file and loaded in some Web browser. A selected node could be anyone, even some Magic node.</li><br />

<li><b><a href="https://zvezdan-d.github.io/UpdateLocationOfFiles.html">Update Location of Files in Database</a></b> [MM2-4] <img src="New.gif" border="0" height="20px" style="vertical-align: bottom"> <a href="https://zvezdan-d.github.io/UpdateLocationOfFilesNew.html">Enhanced version!</a>:<br />Its purpose is to update serial number of a drive and/or paths of files stored in the database, for example after upgrading hard disk or moving files from/to some network drive with UNC paths.</li><br />

These add-ons are donationware. They are developed by me in my free time. I am not employed by Ventis Media, the company behind MediaMonkey, and I have not been paid by them for these add-ons. If you find any of my add-ons useful and want to contribute to their further development, it would be nice if you send me a small donation using PayPal. You could donate as much as you think appropriate, any amount would be really appreciated. However, if you want to get the enhanced versions, you should visit their pages to see what is the minimum donation for them.
