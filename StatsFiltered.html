This add-on works with <a href="http://www.mediamonkey.com/">MediaMonkey</a> v3.0-4.x. It contains the modified version of the Stats.vbs script made by <i>TheRocket</i> which is included with the program. This version has added support for MM filters/collections, skin styles, progress bar, page in Options dialog with a possibility to toggle display of sections in the report, printing of report, also corrected many SQL queries and values.

This add-on is donationware. I am its sole developer and I worked on it in my own free time. I am not employed by Ventis Media, the company behind MediaMonkey, nor have I been paid by them for my efforts. If you find my add-on useful and want to help its further development, it would be nice if you could send a small donation using PayPal. You could donate as much as you think that is appropriate, any amount would be really appreciated.

This add-on doesn't work with MediaMonkey v5! No add-on made for a previous version of the program will work with MM5, either by me or any other author, since MM5 has completely different programming interface than before. Which means that all MM4 add-ons have to be rewritten for MM5 from scratch.<br /><br />

If you really like my add-on and think that it is essential for your work with the program, you should stay with MM4. Or you could wait for me to port the add-on to MM5, but my interest for that depends only on donations.<br /><br />

Just double click on the StatsFiltered-xx.mmip file; if you are on Vista or Win7 and you got "Product installation error", make sure you have MM3 set to <a href="http://www.mediamonkey.com/support/index.php?/Knowledgebase/Article/View/58/0/extensions-cannot-be-installed">"Run as Administrator"</a>; if you downloaded the installation package with IE7 and it changed its extension to a .zip, you should first change it back to a .mmip.<br />

<p><font size="+1"><b><a id="usage">Usage</a></b></font></p>
Choose the <i>File / Create Reports / Statistics (filtered)</i> option; add-on settings are in the <i>Tools / Options</i> dialog box within <i>Filtered Statistics Report</i> tab.<br />

This add-on is a false positive reported as a worm by F-Secure. The author of F-Secure promised me that will update its database and put the add-on on white-list, but still didn't. If you go to the <a href="https://www.virustotal.com/en/file/2756ae8ca4c01a9d101a4a3c0fa9f63abb514cc55bcded32b7a5c2d60d56b9cf/analysis/1475443321/">www.virustotal.com/en/</a> site, you will see that it is safe tested by 54 popular anti-virus engines; the only one reporting a worm in it is F-Secure.<br />
