    This add-on is donationware. I am its sole developer and I work on it in my free time. I am not employed by Ventis Media, the company behind MediaMonkey, and I have not been paid by them for my efforts. If you find my add-on useful and want to contribute to its further development, it would be nice if you could send a small donation using PayPal.<br /><br />

    You can donate as much as you think appropriate, but you should donate at least <b>&euro;5 EUR</b> or <b>$6 USD</b> to receive SysThematic Contrast version; if you donate at least <b>&euro;15 EUR</b> or <b>$18 USD</b>, you will receive the enhanced SysThematic Chroma version of the skin. It will be sent to you via email attachment. If your personal email address is different from the one used for PayPal, please send me the details of that info.
    <br /><br />
    After donating, if a day or two have passed and you still have not gotten my email, you should check your spam folder; if you cannot find it in there, please send me an email with the information about your donation to:
    <script language="javascript">
    <!--
    var part1 = "zvezdand";
    var part2 = "yahoo.com?subject=Donation for SysThematic";
    var part3 = "zvezdand [at] yahoo [dot] com";
    document.write('<a href="mai' + 'lto:' + part1 + '@' + part2 + '">');
    document.write(part3 + '</a>');
    // -->
    </script><noscript>zvezdand [at] yahoo [dot] com</noscript>. To avoid that from happening, I strongly recommend putting my email address in your contact list before making a donation. This should prevent it from being seen as spam, especially if you use Gmail.<br /><br />
