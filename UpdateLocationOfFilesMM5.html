        This is information about the enhanced version of the Update Location of Files add-on, which works with <a href="http://www.mediamonkey.com/">MediaMonkey</a> v5/20xx (there is also a <a href="https://zvezdan-d.github.io/UpdateLocationOfFilesNew.html">version</a> available for older releases of the program).
        <br /><br />
        The purpose of this add-on is to update the serial number of a drive and/or the paths of files stored in the database. For example, after upgrading a hard disk or moving files from/to a network drive with UNC paths. It allows specifying the old and new base folders (not necessarily the root of a drive), and it could copy the media files from the old to the new location, in addition to updating the location data in the database.
        <br /><br />
        The enhanced version of the add-on enables updating several locations at once and removing of duplicates that could appear as a result of the applied update. However, unlike MM4 that has available both free and enhanced versions of the add-on, MM5 has only the enhanced version that is available to donors.

        <p><font size="+1"><b><a id="installation">Installation</a></b></font></p>
        Start MediaMonkey, open Tools / Addons dialog box, click on the Add button and find the .mmip file.<br /><br />

        You need to accept the license agreement if you want to use this add-on.<br /><br />

        <center><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52153790313_b02f8d1723_o.png" alt="UpdateLocationOfFiles-3.0" border="0"></center>

        <p><font size="+1"><b><a id="usage">Usage</a></b></font></p>
        Using this add-on is very similar to the <a href="https://zvezdan-d.github.io/UpdateLocationOfFilesNew.html">older version</a> of the add-on. After its installation you will find the new <i>Update location of files</i> option in the <i>File</i> menu. When you choose that option, you will get opened the add-on's dialog box. After its first start, you will get selected the first drive from the database that is missing/inaccessible and other options will be set to their default blank/unchecked states; if you change some option in the dialog box and start the update, the settings will be remembered in the persistent.json file, so the next opening of the dialog box will show those last settings.<br /><br />

        With the <i>Old drive</i> and <i>Old path</i> combo boxes you should set the old location of files (source) and with the <i>New path</i> text box you should set the new location of files (destination). To be able to do update, both locations should be correctly specified. If your <i>Old drive/path</i> dropdown lists are not filled with drives/paths, that means that your database is empty, in which case this add-on cannot be used - you should have database that contains files if you want to update their location (as the name of the add-on suggests).<br /><br />

        The <i>Old drive</i> combo box shows all drives containing media files that are added to the database (Library). These are the same drives that you have displayed in the Location sub-folder of the Entire Library collection. When you choose drive from that combo box, the <i>Old path</i> combo box will be filled with all folders from that drive containing files in the database including all their parent folders until the root of drive. For example, if I have one track in the database which has the path C:\Music\Pink Floyd\Time.mp3, there would be listed 3 items: C:\, C:\Music\ and C:\Music\Pink Floyd\.<br /><br />

        With the <i>Old path</i> combo box you are choosing the base folder that you want to update. This means that you will get updated all files from that folder and its sub(-sub)-folders recursively. This also means that you should select the root of the drive in the <i>Old path</i> combo box if you want to update all files from that drive. For example, if I specify C:\Music\, all files which have that on the beginning of the path will be updated, like C:\Music\Pink Floyd\Time.mp3, but not file like C:\My Documents\Pink Floyd\Time.mp3 since it has different base folder.<br /><br />

        The <i>Old location</i> label shows how many media and playlist files from the database are located in the base folder (and its sub-folders) selected by <i>Old path</i>; also, it shows how many of those files still physically exist at that location.<br /><br />

        For example, if my <i>Old location</i> shows "228831 media files + 1329 playlist files, 229920 existing + 240 missing", that means that I have 228831 records about media files and 1329 records containing the information about playlist files stored into the database. The sum of these two numbers is 230160 files and it is equal to the sum of another two numbers (229920 existing + 240 missing). In another words, of all my media and playlist files referenced in the database I have 240 files that are psychically missing on the location that I have specified with the <i>Old path</i>. It is not displayed how many media or playlist files are existing/missing individually, but only for their sum.<br /><br />

        By the way, the records containing information about playlist files are not the same as the records about playlists. The records of playlists could contain the information about the imported playlists files, but if you have playlists that are created by yourself, i.e. they are not created by import from playlist files, then such playlists will not contain the information about playlist files.<br /><br />

        In the <i>New path</i> text box you should specify the base folder which would replace the old one after applied the <i>Update</i> option. For example, if the <i>Old path</i> is "c:\Music\" and <i>New path</i> is "d:\Media\My Music\" then all files in the database that have "c:\Music\" on the begin of path will be updated to "d:\Media\My Music\". You could type the new path on keyboard or you could click on the "..." button to choose an existing drive/folder from the <i>Select folder</i> dialog box.<br /><br />

        Similarly to the <i>Old location</i>, the <i>New location</i> label shows how many media and playlist files from the database physically exist at the base folder (and its sub-folders) specified by <i>New path</i>.<br /><br />

        When you change the old or new path, the add-on will start checking for existence of the files at specified locations which could be time consuming, especially with the large databases and/or media files located on network drives. You don't need to wait for the add-on to finish searching for files since it is executed in another thread just for checking purpose and will be canceled if you click on the <i>Update</i> button. However, it is recommended to wait for add-on to finish with that searching because it will display how many files from the database are found on the new specified location.<br /><br />

        If you have the database containing files stored on several drives/paths, and if you want to update many of their locations at once, you could specify them all in the <i>Old path</i> combo box using " (double quote) or | (vertical line) as separators. The difference between those two separators is that the " separator is (mainly) used for the one-to-one replacements and the | separator is used for the many-to-one replacements. Similarly, the <i>New path</i> combo box could contain multiple paths separated with the " separator, but it doesn't support | as a separator.<br /><br />

        For example, if I have c:\|d:\|e:\ in the <i>Old path</i> and f:\ in the <i>New path</i>, all files located on the c:, d: and e: drives will be updated to f:. However, if I have the <i>Old path</i> as c:\"d:\"e: and the <i>New path</i> as f:\"g:\"h:\ then files from c: will be updated to f:, files from d: will be updated to g: and files from e: will be updated to h:.<br /><br />

        The number of specified " separators in the <i>Old path</i> combo box is recommended to be equal to the number of the " separators in the <i>New path</i>, but that is not necessary. In case that the number of the " separators in the <i>Old path</i> is greater than the number of the same separators in the <i>New path</i>, the rightmost paths from the <i>Old path</i> that don't have the corresponding pair in the <i>New path</i> will be replaced with the last (rightmost) path specified in the <i>New path</i>.<br /><br />

        For example, if the <i>Old path</i> is c:\"d:\"e:\ and the <i>New path </i> is f:\"g:\ then c: will be updated to f: and both d: and e: will be updated to g:. The same result could be get if the <i>Old path</i> is c:\"d:\|e:\. However, if the <i>Old path</i> is c:\|d:\"e:\ then files from both c: and d: will be updated to f: and files from e: will be updated to g:. Here is one more example of using different separators in the <i>Old path</i>: c:\|d:\"e:\|f:\ and with the <i>New path</i> set to g:\"h:\ the files from both c: and d: will be updated to g: and files from both e: and f: will be updated to h:.<br /><br />

        Instead of typing paths by hand on keyboard, you could select paths using the <i>Old path</i> dropdown list and the "..." button next to the <i>New path</i> text box with a mouse. When you choose drive from the <i>Old drive</i> combo box or path from the <i>Old path</i> dropdown list, the selected item from that list will replace the ending part of the <i>Old path</i> input field after the last " or | characters. If the <i>Old path</i> input field doesn't already contain " or | characters, it will be completely replaced with the selected item.<br /><br />

        Similarly, when you choose path using the "..." button, it will replace the ending part of the <i>New path</i> text box after the last " character, but if the <i>New path</i> doesn't already contain any " character, it will be completely replaced with the path specified in the <i>Select folder</i> dialog box.<br /><br />

        The " and | buttons on the right side of the <i>Old path</i> and <i>New path</i> fields allow you to append the corresponding separators to the end of input field using mouse.<br /><br />

        If the option <i>Copy files - from the old to the new location first</i> is turned on, then the files will be physically copied before updating of the database; otherwise, only the data about the location of files in the database will be modified.<br /><br />

        Similarly, if you turn on the <i>Move files - from the old to the new location first</i> option, the files will be physically moved before updating of the database. If you plan to use Copy or Move option, it is recommended that you temporarily turn off the File Monitor option in the Options dialog box (if you have it already enabled) before you open the add-on's dialog box.<br /><br />

        If you have files with the same filenames in the old and new locations, you could determine what will happen when you choose <i>Copy</i> or <i>Move</i> option using the <i>Overwrite files with the same names at new location</i> option. If that option is turned off, the files with the same names at the new location will be kept, as well as the files at the old location (even when the <i>Move</i> option is selected). However, if the <i>Overwrite</i> option is turned on, the files from the old location will overwrite files with the same names at the new location.<br /><br />

        When the <i>Only older Date modified</i> option is turned on, the files with the same names at the new locations will be overwritten only if they have older Date Modified attributes, i.e. the files at the old location are modified sooner. This option is enabled only with MM v5.0.3.2614 or higher.<br /><br />

        If you have the <i>Copy/Move all files beside of media files (e.g. .jpg, .html)</i> option turned off, only the media/playlist files whose records are previously stored in the database could be copied/moved. However, if you have some extra files beside of the media files in their containing folders, e.g. bitmaps with covers or some lyrics/txt/html files, they could be copied/moved together with the media files if you turn the mentioned option on. That means that all (sub-)folders will be copied/moved from the old to the new location recursively. This option is enabled only with MM v5.0.4.2650 or higher.<br /><br />

        The <i>Delete emptied folders</i> is similar to the option of the same name in the Auto-Organize Files dialog box. If you turn that option on, the folders that are left empty after successfully applied movement of media files will be deleted. This option is also enabled only with MM v5.0.4.2650 or higher.<br /><br />

        If you want to update location in database only for files that exist at the new specified location, you should turn on the option <i>Update paths in database only for files that exist at new location</i>. In that case you should wait for the add-on to finish with search for files before you click on the <i>Update</i> button. However, if you turn that option off, you could click on the <i>Update</i> button immediately after you specify the old and new paths, but in that case all files having the specified old path will be updated, even if they don't exist psychically at new location. If you have some corresponding files at the old and new locations that have different paths for whatever reason, e.g. if you changed their folders or filenames in meantime, it would be advisable to turn the mentioned option on.<br /><br />

        You should turn on the <i>Remove %d duplicates of updated files from database and merge their playing data</i> option if you want to remove records from the Songs table in the database about files that will become duplicates after applied the <i>Update</i> command. This option cannot be applied on files that are on UPnP or have URL paths. The add-on treats files as duplicates only if they have exactly the same paths, but it doesn't compare their tags at all. The number displayed in this check box shows the number of files that could be removed on update; it is less than the number of files displayed in the main filelist when you choose <i>Keep/Select/Show duplicates</i> options because the oldest added duplicates will not be removed on update, but will get the merged data (or the newest added, depending on the next option).<br /><br />

        Let say that I have database with two files: c:\Music\A.mp3 with PlayCounter = 5 and d:\Test\A.mp3 with PlayCounter = 2, and let say that I want to update c:\Music\ to d:\Test\. If I have the mentioned option turned off, after the update I will still have the same two files in the database with the unchanged PlayCounter values, but this time (after the update) they both will have the same paths - d:\Test\A.mp3. However, if I turn that option on, after the update I will get removed one file from the database and the file which is first added to the database will be kept and will get merged its playing data with the data of the removed file (in this example the remaining file will have 7 play counts). The LastTimePlayed field in the Songs table will be also modified appropriately (set to the newer date), as well as all play data in the Played table.<br /><br />

        If the option <i>Remove duplicates</i> is turned on, you could choose which duplicates you want to keep when you apply the update with the option <i>Keep duplicates that have: oldest / newest Date added</i>. That option can be useful e.g. if you have two drives in the database with the (almost) same content, but the newer added drive has updated tags in files.<br /><br />

        The leftmost button on the bottom of the dialog box allows showing/selecting of the media files that are missing at the new location or the duplicates of updating files in the main filelist of the program, with the particular action that could be chosen from the menu that is displayed if you click the following arrow button. The options from the menu that could be applied only on the current filelist are: <i>Keep missing files, Keep duplicates, Select missing files</i> and <i>Select duplicates</i>. The options from the menu that will display files from the entire Library are: <i>Show missing files</i> and <i>Show duplicates</i>.<br /><br />

        These options are applicable only if you have displayed List view in the main window, and only after the add-on finishes searching for existing files/duplicates. The <i>Show</i> options applied on the entire Library are drastically faster than <i>Keep/Select</i> options applied on the current filelist, especially if the filelist contains large number of files.<br /><br />

        The <i>Backup</i> button allows you to save a copy of the current (active) database to some safe place. And finally, when all previously mentioned options are set as wanted, the click on the <i>Update</i> button will start the update action (which could take some time). After the update is finished, the affected paths in the main filelist will be refreshed only if you have MM 5.0.4.2650 or higher, otherwise you should restart the program. The paths in the Playing list will be updated as well if the affected files were previously already stored in the database.<br /><br />

        <p><font size="+1"><b><a id="limitations">Limitations</a></b></font></p>
        The UPnP and URL paths cannot be specified for the <i>New path</i>, only paths with a drive letter or network drives with UNC path. However, you could specify UPnP or URL paths in the <i>Old path</i>.

        <p><font size="+1"><b><a id="important">Important</a></b></font></p>
        If you want to use this add-on when replacing the hard disk, it is very important that you turn off the automatic scanning for new media files in the program before you attach your new drive, until you finish with this add-on. If you let the program to automatically scan the new drive adding its media files to the old database, you will end up with the database containing duplicates with files both from the old and new drive.<br /><br />

        It is also recommended that you suspend all activities that could modify database, including playback of files (playing info is updated in database), until the add-on finish with updating.<br /><br />

        This add-on is relatively dangerous and could cause some corrupted data in the current database, especially if you forcibly terminate the program during its execution! Please make a backup of the current database before you apply this add-on. If you want to use the <i>Copy/Move files</i> option of this add-on, it is recommended that you already have a backup of your media files as well.<br /><br />
