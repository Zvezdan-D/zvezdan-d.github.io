    This add-on is donationware. I am its sole developer and I work on it in my free time. I am not employed by Ventis Media, the company behind MediaMonkey, and I have not been paid by them for my efforts. If you find my add-on useful and want to contribute to its further development, it would be nice if you could send a small donation using PayPal.<br /><br />

    You can donate as much as you think appropriate, but if you donate at least <b>&euro;15 EUR</b> or <b>$18 USD</b>, you will receive the enhanced version of the add-on. It will be sent to you via email attachment. If your personal email address is different from the one used for Paypal, please send me the details of that info.
    <br /><br />
    After donating, if a day or two have passed and you still have not gotten my email, you should check your Spam folder; if you cannot find it in there, please send me an email with the information about your donation to:
    <script language="javascript">
    <!--
    var part1 = "zvezdand";
    var part2 = "yahoo.com?subject=Donation for Update Location of Files";
    var part3 = "zvezdand [at] yahoo [dot] com";
    document.write('<a href="mai' + 'lto:' + part1 + '@' + part2 + '">');
    document.write(part3 + '</a>');
    // -->
    </script><noscript>zvezdand [at] yahoo [dot] com</noscript>. To avoid that from happening, I strongly recommend putting my email address in your contact list before you make a donation. This should prevent it from being seen as spam, especially if you use GMail.<br /><br />

    Please do not use the mentioned e-mail address just to send me questions and requests about MM5 port of other add-ons. I will not answer such emails. You should check the info about that in the corresponding Compatibility section.<br /><br />

    <p><font size="+1"><b><a id="compatibility">Compatibility</a></b></font></p>
    There are two different enhanced versions of the add-on: the one that works only with MediaMonkey v2-4, and another that only works with MediaMonkey v5/20xx. The regular (non-enhanced) version of the add-on is available only for MM4!<br /><br />
